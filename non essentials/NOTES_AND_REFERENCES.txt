Employees can go. we dont need that

Also make one for attendance that shows what patrons attended what events

Make a linking table for employees and highest spenders. 

Delete Employees table and employees type table



The linking table is for each visit. Each time we say that this patron has atteneded and participated at this event. and this is how much they spent
